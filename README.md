# Introduction

This project contains sdr scanner written in `c++` to **scan and record multiple interesting frequencies bandwidth in the same time** (eg. 108 MHz, 144 MHz, 440 Mhz,  etc). This is possible by switching quickly between frequencies bandwidth.

Sdr scanner also allows you to record multiple transmissions simultaneously (if they are transmitted on the same band). For example, if one transmission is on 145.200 MHz and the other is on 145.600 MHz, the scanner will record and save both!

It also provides easy but very powerful **web panel** to explore recordings and spectrograms.

# Supported devices

- `rtl-sdr`
- `HackRF`

# Quickstart

## Install docker

If you do not have `docker` installed, follow the instructions available at [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) to install `docker` and `docker compose`.

## Run

Download sample configuration and docker file, then run it. Customize `config.json` to your needs.
```
mkdir -p sdr
cd sdr
wget https://github.com/shajen/rtl-sdr-scanner-cpp/raw/master/config.json
wget https://github.com/shajen/rtl-sdr-scanner-cpp/raw/master/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```

To update docker images to latest version type:
```
docker compose pull
```

Also remember to update `docker-compose.yml` and `config.json`.

## Panel

Open [http://localhost:8000/sdr/spectrograms/](http://localhost:8000/sdr/spectrograms/) and wait for data to collect.

Admin panel available at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/). Username: `admin`, password: `password`.

# Important

### Blacklist kernel modules

If you use `rtl-sdr` remember to blacklist `rtl2832` modules so that the host operating system doesn't attach the devices and instead allows the devices to be claimed by the docker guest instance.

Copy and run this entire section of script at once. Note that one may need to explicitly press enter after pasting to get it to run.
```
sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-rtlsdr.conf > /dev/null <<TEXT1
# Blacklist host from loading modules for RTL-SDRs to ensure they
# are left available for the Docker guest
blacklist dvb_core
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl2832u
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
blacklist dvb_usb_v2
blacklist r820t
blacklist rtl2830
blacklist rtl2832
blacklist rtl2832_sdr
blacklist rtl2838
blacklist rtl8192cu
blacklist rtl8xxxu
TEXT1

```

### Unload any RTL-SDR modules that may have been loaded
```
sudo rmmod dvb_core
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl2832u
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_v2
sudo rmmod r820t
sudo rmmod rtl2830
sudo rmmod rtl2832
sudo rmmod rtl2832_sdr
sudo rmmod rtl2838
sudo rmmod rtl8192cu
sudo rmmod rtl8xxxu

```

## RaspberryPi

Docker version should work on `RaspberryPi`, but keep in mind that `RaspberryPi` is **not powefull machine** and is **not good** for sdr data processing. `sdr` device can produce **40 megabytes per second**! It's a lot of data for `RaspberryPi` to processing in real time. It's a lot of data even for some desktop computers.

If you still want to do this, please replace the `SD` card with a fast one and make sure you have a strong version of `RaspberryPi`.

Better idea is to build `sdr-scanner` from sources via `cmake` and run natively on `RaspberryPi`. Next run `sdr-monitor` and `mqtt-broker` on any other machine (even in the cloud) and connect `sdr-scanner` to them (you have to set valid mqtt data in `config.json` and maybe manipulate in `docker-compose.yml`).

## Noise learner

To auto-detect transmissions, sdr scanner has to learn noise level every run. It takes first `n` seconds (defined in `config.json` as `noise_learning_time_seconds` default is `30` seconds). So if any transmission will appear in this period it's may not be detected by scanner later.

## Torn transmissions detector

Sdr scanner has feature to avoid recording torn transmission like below.

![](images/torn_transmission.png?raw=1)

It takes first `n` seconds (defined in `config.json` as `torn_transmission_learning_time_seconds` default is `60` seconds) seconds.

## Auto-recording

So sdr scanner starts auto-recording transsmions after `noise_learning_time_seconds` + `torn_transmission_learning_time_seconds`.

## Required resources

Using this software with `HackRF` and `sample rate` `10 MHz` and above needs strong PC. In most casies, `Raspberry Pi` will not be enough.

For example, `HackRF` with `sample rate` `20 Mhz` generates about `40 MB` of data every second, and processing it in real-time needs a strong CPU with multiple cores and some memory resources.

# Config

All of the following examples should be used in the `config.json` file.

## rtl-sdr

### single frequency range

To scan single frequency range:
```
{
  "scanner_frequencies_ranges": [
    {
      "device_serial": "auto",
      "ranges": [
        {
          "start": 144000000,
          "stop": 146000000,
          "sample_rate": 2048000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### ppm and gain

To set `ppm` to `5` and `gain` to `49.6`:
```
{
  "devices": {
    "rtl_sdr": {
      "ppm_error": 5,
      "tuner_gain": 49.6,
      "offset": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## HackRF

### single frequency range

To scan single frequency range:
```
{
  "scanner_frequencies_ranges": [
    {
      "device_serial": "auto",
      "ranges": [
        {
          "start": 430000000,
          "stop": 450000000,
          "sample_rate": 20480000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### gain

To set `lna` to `16` and `gain` to `42`:
```
{
  "devices": {
    "hack_rf": {
      "lna_gain": 16,
      "vga_gain": 42,
      "offset": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Ignored frequencies

To ignore annoying frequency that you are not interested use `ignored_frequencies`. For example to ignore frequency `144 Mhz` with width `20 kHz` and `145.350 Mhz` with width `50 kHz` use:
```
{
  "ignored_frequencies": [
    {
      "frequency": 144000000,
      "bandwidth": 20000
    },
    {
      "frequency": 145350000,
      "bandwidth": 50000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use multipe devices

To use two dongles with serials `11111111` and `22222222`:
```
{
  "scanner_frequencies_ranges": [
    {
      "device_serial": "11111111",
      "ranges": [
        {
          "start": 144000000,
          "stop": 146000000,
          "sample_rate": 2048000
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "device_serial": "22222222",
      "ranges": [
        {
          "start": 440000000,
          "stop": 442000000,
          "sample_rate": 2048000
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If you have multiple `rtl-sdr` dongles with the same serial you can change it with `rtl_eeprom -s 12345678`.

## Scan multipe frequencies ranges

To scan `144 Mhz - 146 Mhz` and `440 Mhz - 442 Mhz` in the same time:
```
{
  "scanner_frequencies_ranges": [
    {
      "device_serial": "auto",
      "ranges": [
        {
          "start": 144000000,
          "stop": 146000000,
          "sample_rate": 2048000
        },
        {
          "start": 440000000,
          "stop": 442000000,
          "sample_rate": 2048000
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom fft

It is possible to set custom fft on spectrogram.
```
{
  "scanner_frequencies_ranges": [
    {
      "device_serial": "auto",
      "ranges": [
        {
          "start": 144000000,
          "stop": 146000000,
          "sample_rate": 2048000,
          "fft": 16384
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Debugging

If you have some problems with this software follow the steps to get debug log.

Set `"console_log_level": "trace"` in `config.json`.

Then run app normally by `docker compose up`. After the error run `docker compose logs > logs.txt`. Please attach `logs.txt` if you create a new issue. Do not paste logs directly to issue. Upload it to any file host service ([https://file.io/](https://file.io/), [https://pastebin.com/](https://pastebin.com/) or any you like).

# Timezone

If timezone detection not work correctly and it seems to use `UTC` instead your timezone please set timezone in host system. To set `Europe/Warsaw` type:
```
echo "Europe/Warsaw" > /etc/timezone
```
